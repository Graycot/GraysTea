        <h3>What is Cozy Ring?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Cozy Ring is a WebRing run by Gray</strong>. 
            I wanted to understand how webrings work, and by tweaking the code by the <a href="#">OnionRing</a> creators, I was able to do just that. 
        </p>

        <h3>Who is this WebRing for?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            If your website is "Cozy" or it's main theme is of a warm, comfortable place, then you are welcome here! This can include but is not limited to personal sites, art gallerys, blogs, and entertainment.
            We want to curate a relaxing and calming environment. As long as the design and content of your website are not chaotic and overwhelming, you are welcome to join. We recognize that the tones of calming & comfort come in many different flavors, and we welcome them all to our little corner of the internet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How can I Join?</h3>
