            <h2> Gray's Tea </h2>
            <p>
                This is where you are currently at! Gray's Tea is my Neocities home and hub for social interaction. Feel free to browse the navigation buttons at the top of the page. You can join the discord server, browse high quality WebDev educational material, find helpful tools, software download links, and explore a lengthy and curated list of other fascinating Netizen's webpages! I intend for this space to act as a community gathering point as well as a bookmarkable list of unique and interesting links.
            </p>
            <h2>CozyRing</h2>
            <p>
                CozyRing is a webring currently in development! Version 1 was deployed and functional, but I was not happy with the requirement for members to use a script tag to load remote javascript for the widget. Version 2 is currently in the works, and if all goes well, a javascript widget as well as href links will be provided once it is complete! Additionally, I aim to make the website application process automatic so that the webring will not stagnate should I not maintain it for a period of time.

            <h2>Graycot.com</h2>
            <p>
                Graycot.com is my first endeavor into hosting a website on Netlify, purchasing a domain name, and connecting the domain name to a website! I intend to test my experimental projects here, as the host is much more flexible than Neocities. For example, In VSCode I can click the sync button to push my commits to a github repository, which will be noticed by Netlify and cause the website to update with the new changes almost immediately. This is extreamly useful, as I do not need to interrupt my workflow to copy the project files and paste them into the website directory each time I wish to publish new changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, this site will be act as quarantine zone. Experimental ideas with the potential for damage will not interfere with Gray's Tea.

            <h2>Free CSS Grid templates</h2>
            <p>
                I have made a few CSS Grid templates to help people position items on their webpages. Additionally, I account for various screen sizes, including <strong>large monitors, vertical monitors, normal desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</strong> All templates are completely responsive. The majority of the templates feature dedicated layouts for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. I had started to gather a small collection of these example grids that I have created, and then I realized that it would be a great idea to share them here!
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply click the picture of the template you would like to view (all the pictures will be in Desktop layout) and you will be taken to a codepen where you can change the size of the browser to see how the layouts change between Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. The HTML & CSS will also be avaliable to copy.
            </p>
