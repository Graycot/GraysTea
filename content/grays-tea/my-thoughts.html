            <strong>The views expressed below this line are controversial, and will likely offend anyone who reads them</strong>. Especially the section titled "Political". Know that I am not infallible, and in a few years I may look back at These
            and think "Wow, that was a bad take." I recognize that my views will change over time, and I am okay with that. The views as stated are limited to the time that they were written, early Febuary of 2022. I may have completely changed
            positions on some in the future, and that is a possibility I accept. I am willing to grow and change with my circumstance. I don't see it as hypocrisy to change my views on a subject after learning more, but rather, the natural progression of education.
            <strong>I enjoy civil discussion, and if you would like to have a good faith conversation to challenge my ideals, I will gladly welcome it. The only thing that I ask is that you have an open mind when reading my stances, and recognize that I am only human, a product of my environment and time.</strong>

        <h3> Views on Government </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Economic: </h4>
        <p>
            Capitalism has failed. Great in theory and at the scale of small buisnesses and individual people. Horrifying in the moderen age of trillion dollar corporations that "donate" millions of dollars per year to polititions in order to gain legislative favor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Communism has failed. It cannot be implemented without a strong central authority. A strong central authority can be extremly efficient, but also extreamly abusive to its subjects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Power Centralization: </h4>
        <p>
            Democracy has failed. Democracy in itself is wonderful, but under capitalist influence, it is corrupted and transformed into a corporate oligarchy. Democracy is also incompatiable with the strong central authority needed for communism.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Authoritatianism has... succeeded? Wait, what? Case study: China. Extremely efficient (for a Government), has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty over the last 4 decades, has incredible infrastructure and public works,
            booming economy, (mostly) socially cohesive, and incredible power on the global scale.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cons: Human rights are a foreign concept. Censorship is the name of the game, and international aggression is frequent. Voices are supressed, freedoms are non-existant, government propganda is ingrained from birth, and a fair bit of genoicde of those who are "different".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Well, that surely put a damper on the mood... So, in a nutshell, Authoritatianism (with a mixed capitalist/communist economy like china) is the best for a nation to prosper, but horrendous for its people. In the past,
            nations like these would decay with revolt and rebellion, but in the modern age of the police state, authoritarian systems of government may be the most stable form of government continuity on long timescales, and may be the end result of Democracies. 
            It is much easier for a Democracy to turn into an Authoritarian system than it is for an Authoritarian to turn into a Democracy. That is, to put it gently, unsettling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Do I have a solution or suggestion on how these things can be improved? <strong>Nope</strong>. Pointing out problems is much easier than fixing them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Political: </h4>
        <p>
            I believe that the political system in the United States is broken. I do not subscribe to the patronizing views of the Democratic Party nor do I subscribe to the... lack of views... of the Republican Party.
            The Independent party is talking to their make believe friends, while the libertarian party is a cesspool of degeneracy. As you can tell, I do not like political parties.
            Now that I have just offended every American reader, Let explain why I hold such a strong distaste of America's politcal scheme.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First, I do not necessarily dislike the people who participate in these political parties. Rather, I am disgusted by the vile mob mentality and echo chambers that the leaders of these organizations have
            cultivated. Anger and Fear are the two most powerful forces in this world, and political parties by design have the cause and the ability to weaponize these emotions. 
       </p>
       <p>
           There seems to be two realities in the Unites States. Lets just call them the Red and Blue realities.
           Team Blue is closer to the truth, but not willing to go all the way. They would rather live without confrontation of the current crisis, hoping it'll just "get better". 
           The radical Blue are energetic and have the willpower to cause change, but unfortunately, they do not have the organization to effectively channel that willpower into meaningful action. 
           When they do organize, they usually point the barrel at themselves rather than the opposition, consistently embarrassing themselves and loosing the legitimacy of their cause.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
            Team Red is much further from reality. The leaders actively profit off of crisis, using the anger of their base to be re-elected and claim more profit at the tax-payers expense. Corruption is ripe within both parties,
            but team red no longer puts on the show to pretend that it is not there. The Red organizers have learned that there are no consequences for selling out the public office. Rather, their base will eagaerly support them no matter what they do.
            There is no empathy for fellow humans among the Red's leadership, not even for their own base. At the very least, the blue leadership pretends to care.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As for the radical Red, which makes up a significant portion of the base, they are complete and utterly disconnected from reality. Facts and logical discussion are fruitless, as they refuse to participate in good-willed discussion.
            They plug their ears and scream that life is unfair and that they are being oppressed while mercilessly stomping on the skulls of others. Any fact or uncomfortable truth is dimissed as "fake news" because it does not fit their internal narrative.
            After lying to themselves in order to prevent their beliefs being challanged, they may come to actually believe the dribble that they spout.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
           and then there is team green, who are probably wanking behind a bush or something.
       </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Obviously I am making broad generalizations, and these statements do not apply to every single individual of every political party, but I fully stand by my statements as they apply to the core mob mentality of these organizations.
        </p>
