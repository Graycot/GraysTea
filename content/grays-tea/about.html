            Hello! Welcome to my digital bungalow. My name is Gray, and in this article I will be telling you
            who I am, my interests, why I made this place, and what I hope to achieve here on the website.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Who is Gray? </h2>

        <br>
       <p>
            Who or what am I? That is not a straightfoward question. What defines a person? Their age and physical attributes? Their hobbies? Their virtues, philosphy, or action?
            Does one's upbringing play a vital role in shaping the essence of who someone is? What about a persons idiosyncrasies, behaviors, vicies, 
            or beliefs? At what point does something become part of your identity, uniquely used to describe "you"? These are all questions that I struggled with while writing this page.
            While I cannot give a complete response, bearing my soul to the online world for all to see, I can atleast try. Here we go.
       </p>

       <h3> Personality </h3>
       <br>
       <p>
        At heart, I am a tinkerer. I enjoy testing things, observing the cause and affect of my modifications. 
        I relish the opportunity to utilize an object or service in an unintended way, discovering the quirks and intricate naunce hidden from common view.
        I find my fulfilment in the perplexion of the mundane and ordinary, the forgotten and unused.
        Deconstructing the abstractions of reality into their smallest components keeps me entertained, 
        whether it be pondering the physical proccesses of baking a croissant or the specific electromagnetic frequency of a soft, cool blue.

        <h3> Philosphy & Values </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I structure my life around John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle. I believe in the freedom of action so long as that action does not deprive another of their freedom of action.
            That is the gist of it. There is much more nuance and necessary distinctions between "harm" and "offence", but this is not the place to explain the theory, nor could I articulate 
            the theory better than JS Mill on the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3> Beliefs & Faith</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I don't believe in a god. Likewise, I don't believe in a lack of god either. To be fair, there are few things that I truly believe in, as having beliefs will encourage me to ignore evidence that contradicts my belief.
            I guess my one true belief that I hold is that any belief I invest myself in will one day lead to contradiction and disappointment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>What Is the purpose of life?</h4>
        <p>
            I don't think life has a purpose. I am a fancy clump of cells that will exist for a blink on cosmic timescales. I am not special or deserving of anything from the universe's point of view.
            I am not different than an ant to the earth, and that knowledge is somehow refreshing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Planning life:</h4>
        <p>
            Unless one lives an exhaustingly boring life, I do not see the point in planning more than 6 months ahead. Exceptions being finances and a few other specific goals, not much can be foretold about the future.
            You could move across the country, find new friend, have a great job application accepted, find the love of your life, lose your job, discover that your partner had an affair, be a victim of a traumatic event, or be diagnosed with a debilitating disease.
            There are plenty of ways that your life could be turned upsidedown, for better or worse. At best. pre-planning your life will cause dissapointment as your plans fall short. At worst, pre-planning your life will cause you
            to ignore spontaneous opportunities that could have changed your life for the better AND cause dissapointment as your plans fall short.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>   
            If present day Gray relies on plans that future day Gray must achieve to avoid a problematic situation, then Gray is at a signifcant liability of an uncertain future. The same line of reasoning applies to anyone.
            If I take out $300,000 of student loans now and rely on future me to pay back those loans, then what happens if I flunk out of college, or the job compensation is not as lucrative as I expected? 
            Then I owe $300,000 and interest, and I don't have a feasiable way of paying it off. To put it kindly, if you are in that sort of situation, you fucked up. You relied on future you to accept the risk of past you,
            and the gamble did not go in your favor. Its a trap that many people fall into, and with the absolutely garbage social welfare saftey net in the United States, it is essentially a life sentence. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now, when I say that planning for <strong><em>the future</em></strong> is pointless, I do not mean that planning for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> is pointless. You may be asking, what is the difference between
            <strong><em>the future</em></strong> and <strong><em>a future</em></strong>? Let me break it down.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong><em>the future</em></strong>: is the inevitable course that time will take between now and a date that has not yet occured. <strong><em>the future</em></strong>  is unknown, and we can only reflect on it after is has occured.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong><em>a future</em></strong>: is one of the possible courses that the future could take. It is unknown with certainty which one of the many courses that the true future could take. <strong><em>a</em></strong> is simply a possibility. It is not a guarentee that it will or will not happen.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Planning for <strong><em>the future</em></strong> will backfire. You cannot predict <strong><em>the future</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Planning for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> is smart. You can plan and coordinate your actions ahead of time incase a situation takes place.
            Have you ever participated in a fire-drill at school? The purpose of the drill is to plan for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> in which there is a fire. <strong>it does NOT predict that there WILL be a fire.</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You can plan for a job loss by saving money in a emergency fund. You can plan for a unexpected snow storm by keeping extra warm clothes and batteries. You can plan for a medical catastrophe by having comphrensive insurance.
            None of these potential futures are optimal, but you can plan for the event that <strong>a possible negative future</strong> could become <strong><em>the future</em></strong>. You cannot plan without signifcant risk that <strong><em>a future</em></strong> you want will become <strong><em>the future.</em></strong>

        <h3> Creating Grays Tea </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Gray's Tea has gone though nearly two months of prior development before I scrapped the entire codebase and started from scratch. I'll call that version of Grays Tea the <em>legacy version</em>.
            I should have an archive of the old site <em>*checks pockets, flips over rock*</em> somewhere around here... 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The new Gray's Tea exists to serve 4 functions: 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>1) A practice project for web development:</h4>
        <p>

            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>2) An educational resource for others adventuring into tech:</h4>
        <p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>3) An archive of my digital existence:</h4>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>4) A community gathering point for like-minded netizens:</h4>
        <p>

            <strong>The views expressed below this line are controversial, and will likely offend anyone who reads them</strong>. Especially the section titled "Political". Know that I am not infallible, and in a few years I may look back at These

            positions on some in the future, and that is a possibility I accept. I am willing to grow and change with my circumstance. I don't see it as hypocrisy to change my views on a subject after learning more, but rather, the natural progression of education.
            <strong>I enjoy civil discussion, and if you would like to have a good faith conversation to challenge my ideals, I will gladly welcome it.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Views on Government </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> Economic: </h4>
        <p>
            Capitalism has failed. Great in theory and at the scale of small buisnesses and individual people. Horrifying in the moderen age of trillion dollar corporations that "donate" millions of dollars per year to polititions in order to gain legislative favor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Communism has failed. It cannot be implemented without a strong central authority. A strong central authority can be extremly efficient, but also extreamly abusive to its subjects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4> Power Centralization: </h4>
        <p>
            Democracy has failed. Democracy in itself is wonderful, but under capitalist influence, it is corrupted and transformed into a corporate oligarchy. Democracy is also incompatiable with the strong central authority needed for communism.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Authoritatianism has... succeeded? Wait, what? Case study: China. Extremely efficient (for a Government), has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty over the last 4 decades, has incredible infrastructure and public works,
            booming economy, (mostly) socially cohesive, and incredible power on the global scale.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cons: Human rights are a foreign concept. Censorship is the name of the game, and international aggression is frequent. Voices are supressed, freedoms are non-existant, government propganda is ingrained from birth, and a fair bit of genoicde of those who are "different".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Well, that surely put a damper on the mood... So, in a nutshell, Authoritatianism (with a mixed capitalist/communist economy like china) is the best for a nation to prosper, but horrendous for its people. In the past,
            nations like these would decay with revolt and rebellion, but in the modern age of the police state, authoritarian systems of government may be the most stable form of government continuity on long timescales, and may be the end result of Democracies. 
            It is much easier for a Democracy to turn into an Authoritarian system than it is for an Authoritarian to turn into a Democracy. That is, to put it gently, unsettling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Do I have a solution or suggestion on how these things can be improved? <strong>Nope</strong>. Pointing out problems is much easier than fixing them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Political: </h4>
        <p>
            I believe that the political system in the United States is broken. I do not subscribe to the patronizing views of the Democratic Party nor do I subscribe to the... lack of views... of the Republican Party.
            The Independent party is talking to their make believe friends, while the libertarian party is a cesspool of degeneracy. As you can tell, I do not like political parties.
            Now that I have just offended every American reader, Let explain why I hold such a strong distaste of America's politcal scheme.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First, I do not necessarily dislike the people who participate in these political parties. Rather, I am disgusted by the vile mob mentality and echo chambers that the leaders of these organizations have
            cultivated. Anger and Fear are the two most powerful forces in this world, and political parties by design have the cause and the ability to weaponize these emotions. 
       </p>
       <p>
           There seems to be two realities in the Unites States. Lets just call them the Red and Blue realities.
           Team Blue is closer to the truth, but not willing to go all the way. They would rather live without confrontation of the current crisis, hoping it'll just "get better". 
           The radical Blue are energetic and have the willpower to cause change, but unfortunately, they do not have the organization to effectively channel that willpower into meaningful action. 
           When they do organize, they usually point the barrel at themselves rather than the opposition, consistently embarrassing themselves and loosing the legitimacy of their cause.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
            Team Red is much further from reality. The leaders actively profit off of crisis, using the anger of their base to be re-elected and claim more profit at the tax-payers expense. Corruption is ripe within both parties,
            but team red no longer puts on the show to pretend that it is not there. The Red organizers have learned that there are no consequences for selling out the public office. Rather, their base will eagaerly support them no matter what they do.
            There is no empathy for fellow humans among the Red's leadership, not even for their own base. At the very least, the blue leadership pretends to care.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As for the radical Red, which makes up a significant portion of the base, they are complete and utterly disconnected from reality. Facts and logical discussion are fruitless, as they refuse to participate in good-willed discussion.
            They plug their ears and scream that life is unfair and that they are being oppressed while mercilessly stomping on the skulls of others. Any fact or uncomfortable truth is dimissed as "fake news" because it does not fit their internal narrative.
            After lying to themselves in order to prevent their beliefs being challanged, they may come to actually believe the dribble that they spout.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
           and then there is team green, who are probably wanking behind a bush or something.
       </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Obviously I am making broad generalizations, and these statements do not apply to every single individual of every political party, but I fully stand by my statements as they apply to the core mob mentality of these organizations.
        </p>
