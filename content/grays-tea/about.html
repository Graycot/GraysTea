            Hello! Welcome to my digital bungalow. My name is Gray, and in this article I will be telling you
            who I am, my interests, why I made this place, and what I hope to achieve here on the website.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Who is Gray? </h2>

        <br>
       <p>
            Who or what am I? That is not a straightfoward question. What defines a person? Their age and physical attributes? Their hobbies? Their virtues, philosphy, or action?
            Does one's upbringing play a vital role in shaping the essence of who someone is? What about a persons idiosyncrasies, behaviors, vicies, 
            or beliefs? At what point does something become part of your identity, uniquely used to describe "you"? These are all questions that I struggled with while writing this page.
            While I cannot give a complete response, bearing my soul to the online world for all to see, I can atleast try. Here we go.
       </p>

       <h3> Personality </h3>
       <br>
       <p>
        At heart, I am a tinkerer. I enjoy testing things, observing the cause and affect of my modifications. 
        I relish the opportunity to utilize an object or service in an unintended way, discovering the quirks and intricate naunce hidden from common view.
        I find my fulfilment in the perplexion of the mundane and ordinary, the forgotten and unused.
        Deconstructing the abstractions of reality into their smallest components keeps me entertained, 
        whether it be pondering the physical proccesses of baking a croissant or the specific electromagnetic frequency of a soft, cool blue.

        <h3> Philosphy & Values </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I structure my life around John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle. I believe in the freedom of action so long as that action does not deprive another of their freedom of action.
            That is the gist of it. There is much more nuance and necessary distinctions between "harm" and "offence", but this is not the place to explain the theory, nor could I articulate 
            the theory better than JS Mill on the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3> Beliefs & Faith</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I don't believe in a god. Likewise, I don't believe in a lack of god either. To be fair, there are few things that I truly believe in, as having beliefs will encourage me to ignore evidence that contradicts my belief.
            I guess my one true belief that I hold is that any belief I invest myself in will one day lead to contradiction and disappointment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>What Is the purpose of life?</h4>
        <p>
            I don't think life has a purpose. I am a fancy clump of cells that will exist for a blink on cosmic timescales. I am not special or deserving of anything from the universe's point of view.
            I am not different than an ant to the earth, and that knowledge is somehow refreshing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Planning life:</h4>
        <p>
            Unless one lives an exhaustingly boring life, I do not see the point in planning more than 6 months ahead. Exceptions being finances and a few other specific goals, not much can be foretold about the future.
            You could move across the country, find new friend, have a great job application accepted, find the love of your life, lose your job, discover that your partner had an affair, be a victim of a traumatic event, or be diagnosed with a debilitating disease.
            There are plenty of ways that your life could be turned upsidedown, for better or worse. At best. pre-planning your life will cause dissapointment as your plans fall short. At worst, pre-planning your life will cause you
            to ignore spontaneous opportunities that could have changed your life for the better AND cause dissapointment as your plans fall short.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>   
            If present day Gray relies on plans that future day Gray must achieve to avoid a problematic situation, then Gray is at a signifcant liability of an uncertain future. The same line of reasoning applies to anyone.
            If I take out $300,000 of student loans now and rely on future me to pay back those loans, then what happens if I flunk out of college, or the job compensation is not as lucrative as I expected? 
            Then I owe $300,000 and interest, and I don't have a feasiable way of paying it off. To put it kindly, if you are in that sort of situation, you fucked up. You relied on future you to accept the risk of past you,
            and the gamble did not go in your favor. Its a trap that many people fall into, and with the absolutely garbage social welfare saftey net in the United States, it is essentially a life sentence. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now, when I say that planning for <strong><em>the future</em></strong> is pointless, I do not mean that planning for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> is pointless. You may be asking, what is the difference between
            <strong><em>the future</em></strong> and <strong><em>a future</em></strong>? Let me break it down.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong><em>the future</em></strong>: is the inevitable course that time will take between now and a date that has not yet occured. <strong><em>the future</em></strong>  is unknown, and we can only reflect on it after is has occured.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong><em>a future</em></strong>: is one of the possible courses that the future could take. It is unknown with certainty which one of the many courses that the true future could take. <strong><em>a</em></strong> is simply a possibility. It is not a guarentee that it will or will not happen.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Planning for <strong><em>the future</em></strong> will backfire. You cannot predict <strong><em>the future</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Planning for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> is smart. You can plan and coordinate your actions ahead of time incase a situation takes place.
            Have you ever participated in a fire-drill at school? The purpose of the drill is to plan for <strong><em>a future</em></strong> in which there is a fire. <strong>it does NOT predict that there WILL be a fire.</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You can plan for a job loss by saving money in a emergency fund. You can plan for a unexpected snow storm by keeping extra warm clothes and batteries. You can plan for a medical catastrophe by having comphrensive insurance.
            None of these potential futures are optimal, but you can plan for the event that <strong>a possible negative future</strong> could become <strong><em>the future</em></strong>. You cannot plan without signifcant risk that <strong><em>a future</em></strong> you want will become <strong><em>the future.</em></strong>

        <h3> Creating Grays Tea </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Gray's Tea has gone though nearly two months of prior development before I scrapped the entire codebase and started from scratch. I'll call that version of Grays Tea the <em>legacy version</em>.
            I should have an archive of the old site <em>*checks pockets, flips over rock*</em> somewhere around here... 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The new Gray's Tea exists to serve 4 functions: 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>1) A practice project for web development:</h4>
        <p>

            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>2) An educational resource for others adventuring into tech:</h4>
        <p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>3) An archive of my digital existence:</h4>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>4) A community gathering point for like-minded netizens:</h4>
        <p>
